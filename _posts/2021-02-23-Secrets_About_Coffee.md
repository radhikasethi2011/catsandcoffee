title: Secrets about speciality coffee that you aren't aware of!
---

The past few days have been beginning and ending with a different batch of beans. I'm not a connoisseur yet, but getting closer to it everyday. My morning thoughts are more towards a dark roast, and the evenings are for craving for some light and fruity notes. It's just easy to go with a dark roast in the morning, considering they're easier to grind (with a manual grinder), and a good oak-ey/bitter kick. 
Although there are some things I've learnt over these past few months, and corrected a few point of views I've had about coffee. Everything I believed about speciality coffee was wrong, only if I could tell the me five years ago, these secrets about coffee that I know now, and how I was so wrong about it! 
Let's talk about a few common assumptions about coffee, and how they're usually wrong :p

* __Coffee is supposed to be bitter__

    Nope. Nah-uh. Coffee isn't supposed to be bitter at all. Infact, different coffee beans are processed in different ways, and it builds up their complex sugars differently, giving the particular roasted batch a unique taste. Coffee can hit any type of notes, from cola candy, to white chocolate! 

* __Instant coffee is cheaper compared to speciality roasted coffee beans__

    Again, wrong. I've believed this for all my life, and learnt about it late last year. Instant coffee is actually expensive compared to fresh roasted coffee! Yes, even on comparing caffeine/gm of coffee, freshly roasted coffee beans tend to have a higher caffeine content, compared to instant coffee. 

* __Coffee dissolves!__
    
    False. Real coffee does not dissolve in water. Mind blown? Yep. Ground coffee beans do not completely dissolve in water, and hence we separate the grounds from the coffee after brewing. Unlike instant coffee, which is made from coffee beans that have undergone a process of roasting, grinding, extraction and freeze-drying or spray-drying. The process alters the composition and property of the coffee beans so that the resulting product, instant coffee, can dissolve completely and instantly in hot water.

* __I don't know how to brew__

    Meh, you probably do know how to brew coffee. If you've ever made tea, and used a 'channi', guess what, you can brew coffee using a 'channi' as well! Here comes the term - 'channi brew'. It's the easiest way to brew coffee, and quick as well. 
    And if you're a fan of filter coffee just as much as I am, you definitely would've brewed, or tried to brew a filter coffee decoction. (it took me a year to understand how to make a good cup of filter coffee, just like the one at this ðŸ¤¯ south indian food shop nearby my place). After various various youtube videos, finally found the one (will link it) which has made me a better filter coffee person! 

***Takeaways***

Freshly roasted coffee is, infact cheaper compared to instant coffee! 
You do not need to toughen up and drink a cup of black instant coffee (bitter bitter) when you could enjoy a cup of black coffee brewed with freshly roasted beans, and hit those flavour profiles! 
And, why drink a cup of stale coffee when you could make a better cup? The process of brewing is more fun and rewarding (or is this a crazy caffeine addict talking?) 

That's all :)
